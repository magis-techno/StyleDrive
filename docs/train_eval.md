# DiffusionDrive Training and Evaluation

## 1. Cache dataset for faster training and evaluation
```bash
# cache dataset for training
bash scripts/caching/caching_training_tran_diff.sh

# cache dataset for evaluation
bash scripts/caching/run_metric_caching.sh
```

## 2. Training
If your training machine does not have network access, you should download the pretrained ResNet-34 model from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/timm/resnet34.a1_in1k) and upload it to your training machine.

#### DiffusionDrive-Style Model
```bash
bash scripts/training/run_diffusiondrive_style_training.sh
```

#### Transfuser-Style Model
```bash
bash scripts/training/run_transfuser_style_training.sh
```

#### AD-MLP-Style Model
```bash
bash scripts/training/run_ego_mlp_style_agent_training.sh
```

## 3. Evaluation
All the ckpts are open-sourced in [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ryhn98/StyleDrive-Dataset).

You can modify the ckpt's path in the following scripts and run the evaluation as follows:

#### DiffusionDrive-Style Model
```bash
bash scripts/evaluation/run_diffusiondrive_style.sh
```

#### Transfuser-Style Model
```bash
bash scripts/evaluation/run_transfuser_style.sh
```

#### AD-MLP-Style Model
```bash
bash scripts/evaluation/run_ego_mlp_style_agent_pdm_score_evaluation.sh
```
